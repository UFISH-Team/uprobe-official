# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is U-Probe?

U-Probe is a comprehensive tool for designing DNA/RNA probes for various molecular biology applications including FISH, PCR, and sequencing. It automates the entire workflow from target selection to quality-filtered probe generation.

### What makes U-Probe different from other probe design tools?

- **End-to-end workflow**: Complete automation from genome to final probes
- **Highly configurable**: YAML-based configuration for any probe design
- **Quality-focused**: Comprehensive attribute calculation and filtering
- **Flexible design**: Support for complex multi-part probes
- **Multiple applications**: FISH, PCR, sequencing, and custom designs
- **Python API**: Programmatic access for pipeline integration

## Installation and Setup

### Which Python versions are supported?

U-Probe supports Python 3.9 and higher. Python 3.11 is recommended for best performance.

### Do I need to install external tools?

Yes, U-Probe requires:

- **Bowtie2** for sequence alignment
- **BLAST+** for similarity searches
- **Jellyfish** (optional) for k-mer counting

See the [installation](./installation.md) guide for details.

### Can I use U-Probe on Windows?

Yes, but with limitations. The external bioinformatics tools (Bowtie2, BLAST) need to be installed separately. We recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Docker for the best experience.

### Can I run U-Probe without installing Python?

Yes! You can create a standalone executable using PyInstaller. See the [installation](./installation.md) guide for instructions.

## Configuration

### How do I find the correct gene names for my organism?

Gene names must match those in your GTF annotation file. To find available names:


```bash
# Search for a specific gene
grep -i "GAPDH" /path/to/annotation.gtf

# List all gene names
awk '$3=="gene"' /path/to/annotation.gtf | \
grep -o 'gene_name "[^"]*"' | sort | uniq
```

### Can I design probes for multiple species?

Yes! Create separate genome configurations for each species:
```

yaml
# genomes.yaml
human_hg38:
  fasta: "/data/human/hg38.fa"
  gtf: "/data/human/hg38.gtf"

mouse_mm39:
  fasta: "/data/mouse/mm39.fa" 
  gtf: "/data/mouse/mm39.gtf"
```

Then use separate protocols for each species or design cross-species probes with appropriate attributes.

### How do I design probes for custom genomic regions?

Use coordinate-based extraction:


```yaml
extracts:
  target_region:
    source: "genome"
    length: 200
    coordinates:
      - "chr1:1000000-1002000"
      - "chr2:500000-501000"
```

### What's the difference between "exon", "gene", and "genome" extraction?

- **exon**: Extracts from annotated exonic regions only (spliced sequences)
- **gene**: Extracts from entire gene regions including introns
- **genome**: Extracts from specified genomic coordinates

Choose based on your application:
- FISH probes: usually "exon" or "gene"
- Genomic PCR: "genome" with coordinates
- RNA detection: "exon"

## Probe Design

### How do I design FISH probes?

Basic FISH probe configuration:
```

yaml
probes:
  fish_probe:
    template: "{target_binding}TTTTTT{fluorophore_site}"
    parts:
      target_binding:
        length: 25
        expr: "rc(target_region[0:25])"
      fluorophore_site:
        expr: "encoding[gene_name]['fluorophore']"
```

See [examples](./examples.md) for complete FISH configurations.

### How do I design PCR primers?

For PCR primer pairs:


```yaml
probes:
  forward_primer:
    template: "{seq}"
    parts:
      seq:
        length: 22
        expr: "target_region[0:22]"
  
  reverse_primer:
    template: "{seq}"
    parts:
      seq:
        length: 22
        expr: "rc(target_region[-22:])"
```

### Can I use custom sequences in my probes?

Yes! Use literal sequences in quotes:
```

yaml
probes:
  custom_probe:
    template: "{primer}{target_binding}{adapter}"
    parts:
      primer:
        expr: "'ACGTACGT'"  # Fixed sequence
      target_binding:
        length: 25
        expr: "target_region[0:25]"
      adapter:
        expr: "'TGCATGCA'"
```

### How do I reference other probes in expressions?

Use the probe name in expressions:


```yaml
probes:
  probe_1:
    template: "{seq}"
    parts:
      seq:
        expr: "target_region[0:20]"
  
  probe_2:
    template: "{partial}"
    parts:
      partial:
        expr: "probe_1[5:15]"  # Uses part of probe_1
```

## Quality Control

### What quality metrics should I use?

Essential attributes for most applications:
```

yaml
attributes:
  gc_content:
    target: main_probe
    type: gc_content
  melting_temp:
    target: main_probe
    type: annealing_temperature
  off_targets:
    target: main_probe
    type: n_mapped_genes
    aligner: bowtie2
  secondary_structure:
    target: main_probe
    type: self_match
```

### How do I set appropriate filter thresholds?

Start with wide ranges and tighten based on results:


```yaml
post_process:
  filters:
    # Start relaxed
    gc_content:
      condition: "gc_content >= 0.3 & gc_content <= 0.7"
    
    # Then tighten for final design
    # gc_content:
    #   condition: "gc_content >= 0.45 & gc_content <= 0.55"
```

Use the `--raw` flag to examine distributions before setting final thresholds.

### Why are all my probes being filtered out?

Common causes:

1. **Too strict filters**: Relax conditions temporarily
2. **Failed attribute calculations**: Check for missing indices or files
3. **Inappropriate probe design**: Verify expressions are valid
4. **Target region issues**: Try different extraction parameters

Use `uprobe --verbose run --raw` to diagnose.

## Performance

### How can I speed up probe design?

1. **Increase threads**: `uprobe run -t 16`
2. **Use efficient extraction**: "exon" is faster than "gene"
3. **Reduce expensive attributes**: Skip fold_score and kmer_count for initial designs
4. **Process in batches**: Split large target lists
```

yaml
# Fast configuration
extracts:
  target_region:
    source: "exon"
    length: 100

attributes:
  # Keep only essential fast attributes
  gc_content:
    target: main_probe
    type: gc_content
```

### How much memory does U-Probe need?

Memory usage depends on:

- Genome size (human genome ~8GB for indices)
- Number of targets (1000 genes ~1-2GB)
- Sequence lengths and overlap
- Attribute calculations

For large genomes with many targets, consider 16GB+ RAM.

### Can I run U-Probe on a cluster?

Yes! U-Probe is designed for cluster usage:


```bash
# SLURM example
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --mem=32G

uprobe run -p protocol.yaml -g genomes.yaml -t 16
```

## Output and Results

### What do the output columns mean?

Standard columns include:

- **gene_name**: Target gene identifier
- **target_region**: Extracted genomic sequence
- **[probe_name]**: Designed probe sequences
- **[attribute_name]**: Calculated quality metrics
- **chromosome, start, end**: Genomic coordinates

### How do I interpret quality metrics?

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Metric
     - Good Range
     - Notes
   * - gc_content
     - 0.4-0.6
     - Higher = stronger binding, harder to denature
   * - melting_temp
     - 50-65°C
     - Depends on application temperature
   * - self_match
     - <0.7
     - Lower = less secondary structure
   * - n_mapped_genes
     - ≤5
     - Lower = more specific

### Can I export results in other formats?

U-Probe outputs CSV files which can be easily converted:
```

python
import pandas as pd

# Read CSV
df = pd.read_csv('results/probes.csv')

# Export to other formats
df.to_excel('probes.xlsx', index=False)
df.to_json('probes.json', orient='records')
df.to_parquet('probes.parquet')
```

### How do I select the best probes from results?


```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('results/probes.csv')

# Top 5 probes per gene by melting temperature
best_probes = (df.sort_values(['gene_name', 'melting_temp'])
                .groupby('gene_name')
                .head(5))

# Filter by multiple criteria
high_quality = df[
    (df['gc_content'] >= 0.45) & 
    (df['gc_content'] <= 0.55) &
    (df['melting_temp'] >= 55) &
    (df['off_targets'] <= 3)
]
```

## Integration

### Can I use U-Probe in my Python pipeline?

Yes! Use the Python API:
```

python
from uprobe import UProbeAPI

uprobe = UProbeAPI(protocol_dict, genomes_dict, output_dir)
results = uprobe.run_workflow()

# Process results with pandas
filtered_results = results[results['gc_content'] > 0.5]
```

### How do I integrate U-Probe with other tools?

U-Probe works well with:

- **Primer3**: Import U-Probe designs for primer optimization
- **OligoAnalyzer**: Validate secondary structures
- **BLAST**: Additional specificity checking
- **Custom pipelines**: Use CSV outputs as input to downstream tools

### Can I run U-Probe in Docker?
